					<span class="test_answer">Consulted with us on windows blinds for our house and installed them himself.</span>
					
					<p>"Mr. Marshall was a delight to work with from the initial contact. He responded quickly to a phone message, even before I anticipated, and was available for a consultation on short notice. That was important because the windows in my house had just been replaced and we wanted new "honeycomb" fabric blinds installed as quickly as possible. He was also available for an early evening appointment, which my husband and I greatly appreciated. Although we wanted the blinds quickly, we also wanted good quality blinds, and he had excellent options from which to choose, along with a good range of color selections. We also had the good fortune of being able to take advantage of a special offer that saved us nearly a $1,000.00 on the blinds we preferred. As promised, the blinds arrived in two weeks, even a couple of days earlier, and Mr. Marshall arranged an appointment to install them at our earliest convenience. Again, as promised, he had the blinds (21) installed in about two hours. We will definitely choose to go to him if we decide to install window treatments, and I gladly recommend his services."</p>
